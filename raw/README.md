# About This Directory
This directory contains all the "raw" files (read: MS Word files) for the examination rules etc.
Each subdirectory contains all the available translations for the particular document type.

Example:  
Subdirectory `examination_rules` contains all available translation of the `examination_rules` document, e.g. `examination-rules-de.docx`


## IMPORTANT for Mac-OS Users

The standard Mac-OS way of creating PDFs does **not** render hyperlinks correctly,
therefore it's required to "save-as" PDF and select "best for online" in the options dialogue.
