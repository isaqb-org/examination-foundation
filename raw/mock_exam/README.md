# Change History for Mock Exam Questions and Answers

As we maintain binary documents in this repo, we keep a (manually updated) change list.

To build a new release version, set the version as environment variable:

`RELEASE_VERSION=2021.2-rev9 ./gradlew clean buildDocs`

Then copy them over to the docs root folder.
